Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?', 'Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.', 'No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.', 'Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.', 'In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.', 'Yeah?', 'Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.', 'No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.', 'You’re making fun of me. Forget it.', 'Really?', 'Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.', 'I thought it’d be a little more, just more.', 'Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.', 'Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?', 'Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.', 'Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.', 'You mean this weirdly suspicious one?', 'I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.', 'Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.', 'Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.', 'Well, we did it.', 'I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.', 'So, where do we want to hang it?', 'But it’s an expression of our love.', 'Seems a shame to throw it away.', 'God, I love you. I love you so much.'], 'Penny': ['Again, it was miniature golf.', 'You can’t be this proud.', 'Because I beat you.', 'Hi.', 'Okay.', 'This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.', 'Yes.', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Aw, is this your first time?', 'Well, why?', 'You went to the dirty store without me?', 'Well, get it. Get it for me.', 'Yeah.', 'Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?', 'Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.', 'No. No, come on, I want to do it.', 'Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.', 'So what do you think?', 'I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?', 'Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.', 'Almost 1am.', 'Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.', 'How did you get paint in your eye?', 'We sure did.', 'Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.', 'What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.', 'And our butts. Not hanging it.', 'Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.'], 'Sheldon': ['Oh, good. You’re back.', 'As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.', 'Do you want to say it?', 'Sarcasm?', 'Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.', 'No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.', 'After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.', 'Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.', 'Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.', 'That was a lot of puppies.', 'Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?', 'I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.', 'Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.', 'Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.', 'Would you have approved?', 'Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?', 'I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.', 'I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.', 'Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.', 'So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?', 'Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.', 'First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.', 'Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?', 'What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?', 'Yep, you’re mad.', 'I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.', 'Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?', 'But I made a video.', 'I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?', 'Yes. Open it and check.', 'But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.', 'Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.', 'Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.', 'Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.', 'Do you want me to withdraw my application?', 'And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.', 'Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?', 'I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?', 'Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?', 'You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?', 'They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?', 'Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.'], 'Amy': ['We have some exciting news.', 'After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.', 'Let’s say it together.', 'Yes.', 'Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.', 'For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.', 'That’s what I said.', 'It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.', 'Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?', 'Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.', 'But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con or away for work.', 'What are you talking about?', 'You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?', 'Of course not.', 'No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.', 'I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.', 'Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.', 'I would at least mention it before filling out the application.', 'And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.', 'You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.', 'No. Forget it.', 'Please don’t.', 'Why do you even want to do this?', 'Can’t you just tell me?', 'I think I’m gonna go home.', 'You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.', 'Sure. Unless something better comes along.', 'What I want is for us to be planning our future together.', 'We’re on the same planet.', 'Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?', 'Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.', 'You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.', 'Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.', 'I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a couple.'], 'Together': ['We’re getting a turtle.'], 'Scene': ['Emily’s apartment.', 'A pet store.', 'The apartment.', 'Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.', 'Penny’s bedroom.', 'The stairwell.', 'Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj.', 'The apartment.', 'Penny’s bathroom.', 'Emily’s bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard.', 'Penny’s bedroom.', 'The apartment.', 'Emily’s bedroom.'], 'Raj': ['So, where’s your roommate tonight?', 'But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.', 'That’s okay. I can come back later.', 'Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be awkward.', 'Oh, good.', 'Oh, Emily ran back to the~路 hospital, so I’m just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?', 'What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?', 'So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.', 'I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.', 'She’s gonna know I was looking in it.', 'Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.', 'Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.', 'Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was snooping.', 'Hang on.', 'With what?', 'She does.', 'Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?', 'This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.', 'Okay, where should I put them?', 'You’re not helping.', 'You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with this…', 'Oh, no. Hey.', 'How was the hospital?', 'Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.', 'Yeah.', 'You’ve never snooped around my apartment?', 'Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.', 'Thank you for forgiving me.', 'Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.', 'Of course. What?', 'No. Just the drawer.', 'I promise. Why, what’s in there?'], 'Emily': ['Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.', 'And the more important thing to remember is that I’d never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.', 'No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay here.', 'Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.', 'Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.', 'Raj? I’m back.', 'Hi.', 'Fine. What were you doing in there?', 'You were looking in my night stand?', 'So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?', 'No.', 'I can’t believe you don’t trust me.', 'That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.', 'Can I ask you one thing?', 'Did you look in my closet?', 'You promise you didn’t look in the closet?', 'Don’t worry about it. Good night.'], 'Howard': ['How are the taxes going?', 'Those are business expenses. You can write those off.', 'Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what’s up?', 'Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.', 'She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.', 'What’s wrong?', 'So?', 'Why were you looking in it?', 'Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.', 'You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.', 'Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.', 'Okay, let me see the damage.', 'Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.', 'Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?', 'Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.', 'It’s fine. You just need two more nails.', 'In Emily’s eyes.', 'We should hang up.', 'But we’re not going to, are we?', 'What happened to snooping is wrong?'], 'Bernadette': ['Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.', 'A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?', 'What’s happening?', 'Aw. I’m gonna miss her.', 'Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.', 'She sounds really mad.', 'Yeah, we should.', 'Not a chance.', 'Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud.

While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?', 'Yes. Open it and check.', 'But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.', 'Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.', 'Why?

Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?', 'Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?', 'You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?', 'They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?', 'Good idea.

While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?', 'Yes. Open it and check.', 'But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground.

Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?', 'Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars.

We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?', 'Good idea.
